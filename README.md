‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup
To run StudyGen locally, follow these steps:

  Clone the Repository:

    git clone <repository_url>
    cd PDFLearner

  Set up Environment Variables:
  StudyGen requires Google API credentials for Google Drive sync and a PostgreSQL database.

    Google API Credentials:

      Go to the Google Cloud Console.

      Create a new project or select an existing one.

      Enable the Google Drive API.

      Create OAuth 2.0 Client IDs credentials (Web application type).

      Add http://localhost:8080/callback to your authorized redirect URIs.

      Set the following environment variables:

        export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
        export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"

  PostgreSQL Database:

    Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database running (e.g., locally, Docker, or a cloud provider like Render, Heroku).

    Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable. Example:

      export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database_name"

      (For local development, you might use postgresql://localhost/your_db_name)

  Install Dependencies:
  StudyGen uses uv for dependency management.

    uv pip install -r requirements.txt # (assuming you have a requirements.txt, if not, use the pyproject.toml dependencies)
    # Or, if using pyproject.toml directly:
    uv add pdfplumber google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib psycopg2-binary sqlalchemy alembic

  Run Database Migrations:
  Ensure your database schema is up-to-date. (Alembic setup is usually handled within the app.py or database.py for initial table creation, but for full migration support, you'd typically run alembic upgrade head). For this project, the DatabaseManager in database.py calls Base.metadata.create_all(bind=self.engine) on initialization, which creates tables if they don't exist.

  Start the Application:

    streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000

  The app will typically open in your web browser at http://localhost:5000.
